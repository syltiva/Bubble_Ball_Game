# Bubble_Ball_Game
Remember those handheld water games called Basketball Aqua Arcade? Or Waterfuls? The ones where you'd press two buttons on either side to propel a ball or ring to it's target? Those were some of my favorite games as a kid, so I decided to make a 2D game of it using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This was a fun, simple game to make and brought a lot of nostalgia back for me.
